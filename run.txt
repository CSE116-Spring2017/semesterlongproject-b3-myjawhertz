To start the program, you must run Driver.java as a java application.
Once the program launches, you'll see a menu bar and 1 button and an input box to the right of a black box.
This black box is where the fractals will be displayed once a set is chosen.
Use the menu bar on the top to choose a fractal set under "Fractal", color scheme under "Color", and to close the program "File"-> Exit
The color can be changed ONLY once a fractal has been chosen.
The input box allows the user to change the escape distance
"Re-calculate fractal with given escape time" should be clicked once desired escape time is in the text field ONLY after a fractal is chosen. 
If the users entry to recalculate fractal is less then or equal to 0 or any illegal entry, the console will display an error message.
"recalculate fractal with given escape time" button is clicked once user enter's desired escape time
"Recalculate and redisplay the fractal using the default coordinate range" zooms out the fractal to default 512*512
