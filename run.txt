To start the program, you must run Driver.java as a java application.
Once the program launches, you'll see four columns of buttons to the right of a black box.
This black box is where the fractals will be displayed once the set is chosen.
Use the buttons on the right to choose a fractal set, color scheme, set the distance used to calculate
escape times, or close the program.
