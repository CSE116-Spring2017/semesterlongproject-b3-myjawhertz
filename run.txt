To start the program, you must run Driver.java as a java application.
Once the program launches, you'll see a menu bad and 1 columns of button and an input box to the right of a black box.
This black box is where the fractals will be displayed once the set is chosen.
Use the menu bar on the top to choose a fractal set under "Fractal", color scheme under "Color", and to close the program "File"-> Exit
The input text allows the user to change the escape distance
"Re-calculate fractal with given escape time" should be clicked once desired escape time is in the text field.
