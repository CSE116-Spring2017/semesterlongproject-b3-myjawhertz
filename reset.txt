How to reset the zoom level:

On the bottom half of the panel to the right of the FractalPanel, there will be a button labeled
"Zoom Out". When the fractal is fully zoomed out to fit the screen (512x512), the button will be disabled.
This prevents any possible bugs and any unnecessary runtime from happening when there's no need to zoom out.
Whenever the fractal is zoomed in, the button will be enabled. Pressing the button will zoom out the fractal
and bring it back to the original 512x512 view. Also, it'll disable the button again.
